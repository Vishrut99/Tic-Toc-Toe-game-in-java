# Tic-Toc-Toe-game-in-java
The Tic Tac Toe game allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their respective symbols (X or O) on the board. The game continues until one player gets three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or all squares are filled resulting in a tie.
